Recently we had a client come to use that had a unique request. They wanted to programmatically read a PDF file, find a barcode contained in it, read the barcode and get the value it represented and then rename the file to match the value contained in the bar code. Scanning a physical barcode and getting the value is childs play, but reading it out of a file like this was tricky business, and one we werenâ€™t sure we could pull off for a reasonable time and cost at first glance.</description>
